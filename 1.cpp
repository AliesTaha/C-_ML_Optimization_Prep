/*
This question is about working with individual bits in an 8-bit register using three operations:

Set a bit : This operation sets a specific bit in the register to 1.
Clear a bit : This operation clears a specific bit in the register, setting it to 0.
Toggle a bit : This operation inverts the current state of a specific bit, switching it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

In each function, the parameters are:

uint8_t *reg: This is a pointer to an 8-bit register, represented by a variable of type uint8_t 
(an unsigned 8-bit integer). It is passed by reference (using the pointer *) to allow direct modification 
of the register's value.

int bit: This integer specifies the position of the bit to modify, where the valid range is typically 0â€“7 
(for the 8 bits in a byte). Bit 0 refers to the least significant bit (LSB), while bit 7 
is the most significant bit (MSB).

The goal of each function is to modify the register as described using bitwise operations, 
which are efficient and commonly used for such tasks in low-level programming.
